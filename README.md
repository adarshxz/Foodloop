# FoodLoop - Turning Waste into Worth 🥦♻️

FoodLoop is a real-time food sharing platform designed to connect campus and event surplus food with those in need. By leveraging modern web technology, FoodLoop aims to reduce food waste, support community sustainability, and provide easy access to nutritious meals.

## 🚀 Vision

Every year, millions of tons of edible food are wasted, especially at large events and institutional settings. FoodLoop transforms this waste into community impact by creating a seamless, real-time connection between donors and recipients.

## ✨ Key Features

### For Donors (Hostels, Event Organizers, Canteens)
- **Instant Listing**: List surplus food in seconds with photos and descriptions.
- **Photo Verification**: Upload images to show food quality and build trust.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor donation status and coordinate pickups.
- **Sustainability Badges**: Earn recognition for your environmental contributions.

### For Recipients (Students, NGOs, Community Members)
- **Live Map View**: Locate available food nearby using an interactive map.
- **Instant Notifications**: Get alerts as soon as food is listed in your area.
- **Quick Reservation**: Claim meals with a single click.
- **Navigation**: Get clear directions to pickup locations.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Vanilla), JavaScript (ES6+).
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js for a premium, interactive background theme.
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js for real-time geolocation and food mapping.
- **Typography**: Cabinet Grotesk and Crimson Pro for a modern, accessible interface.
- **Assets**: Custom-designed icons and premium visuals for a high-end feel.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **List**: A donor posts details about surplus food (quantity, type, best before).
2. **Notify**: FoodLoop sends notifications to nearby users.
3. **Reserve**: A recipient views the listing and reserves the food.
4. **Pickup**: The recipient follows the map to collect the food.
5. **Impact**: Both parties rate the experience, and sustainability metrics are updated.
